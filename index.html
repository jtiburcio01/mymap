<div class="container">

<p class= "story"> Mayor Adams' mid-year budget cuts could delay planned reopenings for public library branches under repair or renovation by spring 2024. This could greatly affect communities served by The New York Public Library, which currently has 10 branches closed for this reason. </p>
<p class= "story"> The budget cuts primarily affect Sunday service, but will also extend to building maintenance and repairs, according to a <a href="https://investinlibraries.org">statement</a> from The New York Public Library, Brooklyn Public Library and Queens Public Library. </p>
<p class= "story"> Lauren Comito, the executive director of Urban Librarians Unite, works at a public library that’s currently under renovation. While she couldn’t confirm how the budget cuts will affect the renovation timeline, she mentioned that the temporary closure has caused a gap in service. </p>
<p class= "story"> “We're doing a lot of outreach, like a lot of pop-ups out in the community to try to provide library service in this sort of vacuum of having a branch that's getting renovated,” she said. </p>
